# looping
A repo for loops just for practice. 
    The "for" loop.
The for-loop has two html and js files respectively.
   1. For-loop.html && For-loop.js is created to search for single vacant seats in a row. That is one vacant seat after another. Once one vacant seat is accepted by the user, the loop breaks/stops.
   2. Tripple-vacant.html && Tripple-vacant.js is created to search for tripple vacant seats in a row, still using for-loop. It says the user should choose three vacant seats in a row.
Then there is the while-loop. Which the name already states what the file is for. But this time, the seats now has rows and columns that the user can equally choose tripple vacant seats from.
